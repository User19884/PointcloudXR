Unfortunately I could not distribute everything in the Unity project (had some commercial dependencies). But you can download a compiled version from http://www.rslab.se/pointcloud-xr/, or from the Release section of this repo.
The interesting code in the repo is the compute shaders that handles everything. You can see how to use them in  PointCloudManager.cs
